## Task title

- Implementing a RESTful API with Express and local file system

## Task description:

Create a RESTful API using the Express.js framework that interacts with the local file system for a simple JSON file management application. While you can use modules to help you sort or refine your, you need to ensure that we can see your logic in each of the operations with the FS async module.The API should support the following operations:

● Create a new file with JSON data.
● Retrieve a list of all files.
● Retrieve a single file and its content, returned as JSON.
● Update a file JSON data.
● Delete a file.

Please provide the code for setting up the API, implementing these operations, and using the File System module for asynchronous file operations.
